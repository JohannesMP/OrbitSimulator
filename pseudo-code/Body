Body(PVector position, PVector velocity, PVector acceleration, float mass, float radius, int[] fill,
      int[] stroke):
  initialize body with given initial conditions

applyForce(PVector force):
  add force / mass to acceleration

update():
  update velocity using euler's method
  velocity += acceleration * time
  use improved euler's method to update position
  position += averagespeed * time (avg computed using previous and new speed)
  zero acceleration

draw():
 draw the body to the screen as an circle
 draw the body's velocity vector originating from its geometric center
